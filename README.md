# Gut-micro-org-2023

The folder CODE contains all the code used to produce the results presented in the paper *2023, Seppi et al., Emergent Functional Organization of Gut Microbiomes in
Health and in Disease*.
Code is organized in a series of notebooks, which can be effectively treated as a series of scripts.
Part 1   treats the preprocessing of the data
Part 2   treats the definition of the functional table
Part 3.* treats the production of the figures presented in the paper

The DATA folder is divided into tre subfolders: "datasets" pertaining to the tables (taxonomic and functional), "GCN" pertaining to the Genomic Content Network, "metadata" pertaining to metadata of samples and functional annotations of eggNOGs.
Each folder has a "raw" subfolder, containing the original data, and a "remapped" subfodler, containing the data preprocessed, remapped over a common set of ids and saved as parquet. The "remapped" folders are automatically generated from the "row" by running the scripts.

Finally, the RESULTS folders, contains the pdf files of the figures presented in the paper, which can be generated by running scripts 3.*.ipynb.
